# Password Manager App

This project is a **Password Manager** application built using **Django**, which helps users securely store and manage their passwords. The app is designed with a focus on security, user authentication, and a clean user interface. Currently, we have implemented the **user registration** and **login** functionalities, and more features will be added in the future.

## Features Implemented So Far

- **User Registration**: New users can register by providing a username and password. The password is securely hashed before being stored in the database.
- **User Login**: Registered users can log in by entering their username and password. The app verifies the password against the stored hashed password.
- **Welcome Page**: After a successful login, users are redirected to a welcome page.

## Future Features (Planned)

- **Password Storage**: Securely store user passwords and sensitive information, using encryption methods to ensure security.
- **Password Generation**: Generate strong passwords for users when adding new passwords.
- **Admin Panel**: Create an admin panel for managing users, their credentials, and other settings.
- **User Dashboard**: A dashboard for users to manage their saved passwords, including the ability to view, add, update, or delete passwords.
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Add an extra layer of security to protect user accounts.
